		<h1>A quick and dirty guide to creating pixel art</h1>
			<image src="images/zorro.jpg" alt="fox" class="center" >
			<p>Iâ€™m an engineer, not an artist. But recently I jumped head first into the world of pixel art specifically for creating assets from scratch for small game projects. And trust me, if I can do it, then you can too, which is why I decided to write this.
			<p>Ages ago, I programmed video games professionally. Specifically, I worked on Xbox and Playstation games like Indiana Jones, Star Wars Episode 3, and Afro Samurai, all of which required a full staff of very talented artists, animators and designers. Today, Iâ€™m more interested in smaller games that I can build myself, just one guy in a room.<br>

			<br>Back in the day, pixel art was necessary because computers had limited memory and storage capacity, requiring artists to constrain themselves in terms of size and color depth of their </br>

			<br>Today, these limits are a thing of the past, but the medium as an art form is stronger than ever. The pixel art canvas creates a beautiful constraint for artists to work </br>

			<br>ith that, this has been my path so far,</br>
		<h2>Download Asesprite</h2>
			<p>If youâ€™re just starting, I highly recommend Aesprite. Itâ€™s intuitive, cute, and the entire app is in pixel art! It works on all platforms. The trial is free (though you canâ€™t save ðŸ˜ž), but itâ€™s well worth the $15 for the full version.</p>
